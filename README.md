### Project Overview
The objective of this project is to analyze healthcare data to identify trends, improve patient outcomes, and optimize resource allocation. By leveraging data analytics, we aim to enhance decision-making in healthcare operations and patient care. The insights gained will help in predicting diseases, reducing costs, and improving overall healthcare efficiency.

### Tools Used
- POWER BI
- Power Query

### Data Sources
The data for this project comes from Patient_History_Sample_Data.csv, which contain patient records, medical history, and relevant healthcare metrics. These datasets provide insights into patient demographics, diagnoses, treatments, and healthcare utilization patterns for analysis.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
- In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:

1. Data importing and inspection.
2. Assigned appropriate data types to columns.
3. Applied Power Query transformations: removed duplicates, handled null values, Created new columns from existing and performed column merging.
4. Corrected spelling errors, typos, and inconsistencies.
5. Removed records with null values
  
### Key Business Questions Answered
 1. Total no of patients diagnosed?
 2. What percent of patients have history of heart attack?
 3. What percent of patients have history of stroke?
 4. Count of female patients who are not over weight?
 5. No of patients based n health risk?
 6. Average weight of people based on occupation?
 7. Total no of over weight patients based on race?
 8. Find no of normal healthy candidate in ach age group?
 9. No of patients who posse‚Äôs habit of smoking and are at high level health risk?
 10. No of patients who exercises less than 30 minutes and at high health to moderate health risk?


### Project Files

### Insights & Findings
 1. Total no of patients diagnosed are 5182
 2. Percent of patients having history of heart attack is 2.74%
 3. Percent of patients having history of stroke is 2.74%
 4. Count of female patients who are not over weight is 1405
 5. Most patients have Normal type health risk
 6. Patients with Others type of occupation has high average weight of 67kg, folloowed by white collar workers at average of 66kg
 7. Chinese Race ehave most over weight patinets
 8. Patinets age 40-49 are at high normal health condition 
 9. No of patients who posses habit of smoking and are at high level health risk are 37
 10. No of patinets who exercises less tahn 30 mins and at high health to moderate health risk are 856
 
### Recommendations
- Encourage regular health checkups to monitor and manage conditions for the 5182 diagnosed patients.
- Promote heart health awareness programs to reduce the 2.74% of patients with a history of heart attacks and strokes.
- Encourage healthy lifestyle habits among overweight female patients to improve overall well-being.
- Develop targeted weight management programs for high-risk groups like Chinese race patients.
- Raise awareness on smoking cessation to reduce high health risk levels among the 37 smoking patients.
- Promote physical activity initiatives for 856 patients exercising less than 30 minutes to lower health risks.

### Conclusion
The analysis of patient data reveals critical health trends, including a significant number of overweight patients, lifestyle-related health risks, and occupational influences on weight. Most patients fall under the Normal health risk category, but smoking and lack of exercise contribute to higher health risks. Targeted interventions, such as weight management for high-risk groups, lifestyle modification programs, and preventive screenings, can help improve overall patient health and reduce future complications.
